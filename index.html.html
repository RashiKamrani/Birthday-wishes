            <p> You came into my life unexpectedly  but you soon became someone I can always count on but as you say Itâ€™s"GOOD WEIRD".Itâ€™s funny how life works sometimes, isnâ€™t it?
                You were someone I never expected to become so close to and I am grateful for that.Thank you for never giving up on me . Even though we are miles apart but I want you to know that You are always gonna be special and important to me .While I wish I could be there to celebrate with you in person but just know that I am always here with you no matter the distance .You deserve all the best things in life, and Iâ€™ll always be cheering you on. I know birthdays arenâ€™t your thing but Even if itâ€™s just another day for you I want to take a moment to appreciate how important you are to me.<div class=""></div> </p>
